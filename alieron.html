    In order to understand what is alierons, we need to know the concept of aerodynamic lift.
    We have another tutorial on that, so check it out before reading this.
    There are two alierons in an aircraft.
    Both alierons are attached to the wings of the aircraft and they move in opposite direction.
    This controls the roll rate of the aircraft by differentiating the aerodynamic lift in each wing.
    If left wing alieron points upward and right wing alieron points downward, the aerodynamic lift on 
    the left wing is reduced and lift on right wing is increased. This causes the aircraft to rotate
    counter clock-wise(or anticlock-wise). 
    If left wing alieron points downward and right wing alieron points upward, the aerodynamic lift on 
    the left wing is increased and lift on right wing is reduced. This causes the aircraft to rotate
    clock-wise. And this is how alierons control the roll rate of the aircraft.
