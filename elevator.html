        In order to understand what is elevators, we need to know the concept of aerodynamic lift.
        We have another tutorial on that, so check it out before reading this.        
        Elevator is a moving part that is attached to the tail of the aircraft.
        There are two elevators in an aircraft and both move in the same direction.
        This controls the up and down action of the aircraft.
        The aircraft moves up as much as the elevators go up.
        The aircraft moves down as much as the elevators go down.
        And that's how elevators control the direction of the plane.
