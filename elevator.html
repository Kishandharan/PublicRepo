        In order to understand what is elevators, we need to know the concept of aerodynamic lift.
        We have another tutorial on that, so check it out before reading this.        
        Elevator is a moving part that is attached to the tail of the aircraft.
        There are two elevators in an aircraft and they move up and down only.
        And both elevators move in the same direction.
        This controls the up and down action of the aircraft.
        When it moves up, the aerodynamic lift on the them becomes lower than the aerodynamic lift
        on the wings.This causes the aircraft to go up.
        When it moves down, the aerodynamic lift on the them becomes high than the aerodynamic lift
        on the wings.This causes the aircraft to go down.
        And that's how elevators control the direction of the plane.
