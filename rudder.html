        In order to understand what is rudder, we need to know the concept of aerodynamic lift.
        We have another tutorial on that, so check it out before reading this.        
        Rudder is a moving part that is attached to the tail of the aircraft.
        There is only one rudder in an aircraft and they move left and right.
        This controls the left and right action of the aircraft.
        So when this turns left, the aerodynamic lift on left side increases and 
        the aerodynamic lift on right side reduceses and this causes the plane to turn left.
        So when this turns right, the aerodynamic lift on right side increases and 
        the aerodynamic lift on left side reduceses and this causes the plane to turn right.
        Which means, the aircraft turns left as much as the rudder turns left
        and the aircraft turns right as much as the rudder turns right.        
        And that's how rudder control the direction of the plane.
